This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  missing error handling for invalid input.  The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.  The issue involves attempting to parse a user ID as an integer without checking for non-numeric input, which can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. The solution adds comprehensive checks to prevent these issues.
